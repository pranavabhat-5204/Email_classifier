1. It has model.py where the code through which the model is trained is available.
2. It is done using a sequential model which has about 97% accuracy in training and 78% accuracy in testing
3. app.py has the flask application which is used to deploy on hugginface.
4. In hugginface, there was errors in installing Spacy. So in Github, app.py has the code for masking the data before classification which is not available on Hugginface. This was also successful when I ran it locally.
5. your_model_name1 is the model used
